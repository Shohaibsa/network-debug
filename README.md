## Overview

Network Debug is a command-line interface (CLI) tool designed for diagnosing, benchmarking, and optimizing networking on Linux systems. With a focus on Wi-Fi, DNS, TCP, and system tuning, this tool empowers system administrators and developers to improve network performance effectively.

Whether you are troubleshooting a connectivity issue or optimizing your network settings for better performance, Network Debug provides the tools you need in one package.

## Features

- **Wi-Fi Diagnostics**: Analyze Wi-Fi signal strength, channel usage, and interference.
- **DNS Performance**: Test and optimize DNS queries for faster resolution.
- **TCP Benchmarking**: Measure TCP performance metrics to identify bottlenecks.
- **System Tuning**: Adjust kernel parameters for optimal networking performance.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on various Linux distributions.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface with clear output.

## Installation

To install Network Debug, follow these steps:

1. **Download the latest release** from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Shohaibsa/network-debug/releases).
